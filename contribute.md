The Lean Design System documentation is freely available under a Creative Commons license and can serve as a foundation for a lightweight design system documentation. It is written in markdown language and stored in a [Git repository](https://github.com/1corn/leandesignsystem/tree/main), which makes it easy to fork, customize and extend. Individual parts can be adopted without change, edited as needed, or deleted altogether. The diagram below \(fig. 1\) illustrates the structure of the documentation:

Graphics are SVGs with editable text and can serve as templates for new and improved diagrams. An .AI source file may be provided later on or can be requested via an email to: [dan@leandesignsystem.org](mailto:dan@leandesignsystem.org).
