# A Name and a Place

It may almost seem too obvious—but giving our design system a name and place as soon as, well, **today,** could very well get the ball rolling and introduce more structure to our undertaking. Oftentimes, teams already have processes and components in place that could theoretically become part of a larger design system, but due to the fact they were not conceived with a system in mind, their scalability potentials evaporate. A working title and a dedicated space, as simple as it may sound, may help us tie together what we already have and catalyze the conversation around future efforts.

## A Name

A working title will immediately simplify our discussions, as it's much easier to address something that has a name than an abstract concept. It will also help to make clear distinctions between aspects we consider to be related to the design system and those which are not. And perhaps, we can come up with something  more inspiring than _\[Insert company name here\] Design System_. \(A dedicated, independent title is especially well suited for software platforms addressing larger development communities or white-label product ecosystems.\) When it comes to naming our design system, there’s no reason to be overly cautious or too prosaic. We can be playful and imaginative and incorporate attributes that characterize our team or describe our vision. [Material](https://material.io/), for instance, encapsulates the core structural and visual ideas of Google's design system in one short word, without being too narrow or restricting.

## A Place

In the early stages of establishing a design system, the space we create as a first central hub can be anything

  
If we are at a very early stage, this place can be a shared folder or an empty repository; the name might be a working title for now – but designating a specific space and branding our project \(even if provisionally\) will enable us to promote it, , and generally discuss it in a much more natural way.

Maybe some elements of your future design system already exist and they just need a name and a central hub that ties them together. Such an effort increases understanding of the 



At no cost, this will make a concept that is probably still very abstract to some of our coworkers and team mates more tangible and better comprehensible.
