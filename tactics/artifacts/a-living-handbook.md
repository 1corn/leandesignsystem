# A Living Handbook

The Lean Design System methodology prioritizes experimentation over documentation and advocates a lightweight approach to written guidelines, at least during the early stages of building a design system. However, we will probably still need some form of document or knowledge hub alongside our code and design component repositories, where we outline the structure and scope of our design system and write down the principles, norms, and workflows that guide our work.  

* **Scope:** Reference all elements that we consider to be part of our design system.
* **Integrations**: Reference all 3rd party frameworks and resources we're utilizing, explain how they're integrated and what we need to keep in mind in order to use them as intended.
* **Mission:** A design system mission statement outlining the norms and values that guide our work, making our implicit practices explicit.

Through the process of articulating thoughts we can clarify ideas, avoid misunderstandings and illustrate abstract concepts to each other‚Äîespecially if done collaboratively and cross-functionally. We don‚Äôt get bogged down trying to make a document perfect before sharing it‚Äîwe make it good enough to convey our ideas and then improve it collaboratively.
