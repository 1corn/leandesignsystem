# Minimum Viable Design System

Minimum Viable Design System is centered around the following 3 core ideas:

* **Start today:** The best time to start cultivating a design system was the day we started working as a team. The second best time is now.
* **Solve today's problems:** The success of a design system isn't defined by its comprehensiveness or depth of implementation, but solely by the extent to which it helps us solve real problems and build compelling products.
* **Validate continuously:** building the components needed today and starting to use them immediately 

Let's have a closer look at each of them to learn .

## Start now
