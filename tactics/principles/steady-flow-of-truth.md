# Steady Flow of Truth

Single Source of Truth is a key concept of design systems. It is the practice of structuring information such that every individual element is stored and edited in only one place. A SSOT helps to prevent redundancies and unwanted variances and can be called upon to settle disputes. Depending on an organization's goals and background, their SSOT for design components might be a code repository, a documented set of guidelines or a comprehensive UI kit \(built and maintained in tools like Figma or Adobe XD\). Being able to rely on a Single Source of Truth in our design and development processes is essential to avoiding the accumulation of technical and design debt. 

Lean Design System proposes a more flexible approach to this concept. Instead of having one, we establish a steady flow of new components and optimizations populating our . With that, want to achieve several things:

* We want to **foster cross-functional design and development processes** to better understand our respective struggles and establish collective ownership to break up knowledge silos.
* We want to avoid confusion
* We want to **avoid building and validating unrealistic prototypes** that do not adequately reflect the actual capabilities of our technology in order to save us time and frustration.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It should be noted that Steady Flow of Truth heavily relies on [Design Codification](design-codification.md) to work as intended. If we're certain that we don't want to adopt Design Codification for our design system, we might have to make adjustments or skip this tactic altogether.
