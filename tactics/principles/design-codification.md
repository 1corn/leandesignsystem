# Design Codification

In software design there's a saying that _"if it isn’t documented, it doesn’t exist"_. Design Codification is driven by the idea that _"if it isn't codified, it won't persist"_. It's a guiding principle based on the belief that digital product development should be underpinned by semantic software code that can be written, reviewed, adapted, and owned by developers, just as well as by \(visual **and** UX\) designers.

An effective design system makes design and development successes repeatable and transferable. The systematic codification of design represents a lean approach to avoiding repetitive work and unwanted deviations from guidelines, as it minimizes \(or even eliminates\) the need for strict governance processes. Through collective code ownership \(as outlined in [Win Friends, not Battles](win-friends-not-battles.md)\) and continuous optimization \(as outlined in [Steady Flow of Truth](../infrastructure/steady-flow-of-truth.md) and [Tidy up!](../actions/clean-up.md)\) the codebase of a component repository matures with each project and interaction.
