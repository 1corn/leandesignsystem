# Design Codification

In software design there's a saying that _"if it isn‚Äôt documented, it doesn‚Äôt exist"_. Design Codification is driven by the idea that _"if it isn't codified, it won't persist"_. It's a guiding principle based on the belief that digital product development should be underpinned by semantic software code that can be written, reviewed, adapted, and owned by developers, just as well as by \(visual **and** UX\) designers.

An effective design system makes our design and development successes repeatable and transferable. The systematic codification of design represents a lean approach to avoiding repetitive work and unwanted deviations from guidelines, as it minimizes \(or even eliminates\) the need for strict governance processes. Through collective code ownership \(as outlined in [Win Friends, not Battles](win-friends-not-battles.md)\) and continuous optimization \(as outlined in [Steady Flow of Truth](../infrastructure/steady-flow-of-truth.md) and [Tidy up!](../actions/clean-up.md)\) a codified component repository matures with each project and interaction. Digital products are composed of software code and by embracing code as a building material we unlock several powerful concepts and mechanisms related to computational automation and agile tenets:

* Design Codification, if done right, enables **seamless communication and collaboration** between designers and developers. It establishes a shared language that can be adopted by everyone working on digital products.
* Software code **can be stored and versioned** in repositories. We can perform comparisons and mergers of different iterations. We can create forks and branches to experiment with and expand our libraries.
* Repositories and versioning allow for **collective code ownership**, as we can easily trace, evaluate and revert changes.
* Working on shared repositories also allows for sandbox environments and **automated CI/CD pipelines** to be established that enable developers and designers to validate changes right away without having to wait for deployments.
* Codification allows for **code-based manipulations** of design artifacts at runtime, like coloring or animating icons using SVG and JavaScript, eliminating error-prone handoffs and tedious export processes.
* Unlike written guidelines, software code is **unambiguous**.
