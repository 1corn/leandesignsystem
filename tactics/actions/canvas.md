# Canvas!

Depending on where in the process of cultivating a design system we currently are, a lack of buy-in from important stakeholders \(such as other designers, engineers, product managers, or our superiors\) may bog down our efforts considerably. Even if we understand the value of an effective design system intuitively, it's still a rather abstract concept that is best explained using examples, such as early victories and cautionary tales.

> What our early successes look like entirely depends on where and how we start to cultivate a design system‚Äîthe key takeaway is that we document them in a pitchable way and build up a repository of _propaganda material_ we always have at hand.

Canvas! describes a pragmatic approach to intra-organizational design system advocacy‚Äîstill, some underlying structures will help us to reliably promote our proposition. [A Living Handbook](../artifacts/a-living-handbook.md) encourages us to articulate a design system mission, outlining the goals and values guiding our endeavor. This mission statement should be revisited \(and, if need be, updated\) regularly. It's also advisable to start compiling a shared slide deck containing our mission statement and a few vivid success stories right away, so that we're ready to pitch our vision at a moment's notice. These can include projects in which we used components from our library to speed up product development, engineering handoffs we eliminated, and misconceptions we resolved through cross-functional mediation. What our early successes look like entirely depends on where and how we start to cultivate a design system‚Äîthe key takeaway is that we document them in a pitchable way and build up a repository of _propaganda material_ we always have at hand.

## Architecting a guerilla campaign

Once equipped with some promotional material, we can launch our first campaign forays to test the waters and spark wider discussions. Whatever we do, we should always keep in mind that we don't just go out to _promote_ and _educate_, but also to _listen_ and _learn_. As outlined in [Win Friends, not Battles](../principles/win-friends-not-battles.md), understanding each other's struggles and considering them as opportunities for improvement lies at the very heart of Lean Design System methodology. Being responsive to input and feedback will make it much easier to convince fellow coworkers‚Äîand ultimately improve the design of our system.

Whether we already have a working design system in place and aim to catalyze its adoption and development, or whether we just entered the ideation phase and want to recruit allies, any of the following formats should be considered for canvassing purposes.

### Establish _Design System Office hours_

### Have  brown bag sessions

### Host training webinars

### 

Guerilla campaigning

Brown bag sessions, lunch & learn

Goals: Make the design system visible. Make it tangible/understandable. Make it desirable - benefits. Make it likeable.

Build up a repo of success stories. Host webinars and . Illustrate the benefits



Clearly explains the Value Proposition, Principles and that makes it easy for anyone to present the Design Strategy to colleagues, partners, customers and investors.

Give our system a name. \(according to ‚Ä¶ a third of all design systems have to get by without a name\)

Share small victories as well to advocate the
