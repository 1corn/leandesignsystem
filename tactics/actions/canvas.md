# Canvas!

Depending on where in the process of cultivating a design system we currently are, a lack of buy-in from important stakeholders \(such as other designers, engineers, product managers, or our superiors\) may bog down our efforts considerably. Even if we understand the value of an effective design system, it's still a rather abstract concept that is best explained using examples, such as early victories and cautionary tales.

Canvas! describes a very pragmatic approach to design system advocacy, but some underlying structures will help us reliably promote the benefits of the libraries we're building. [A Living Handbook](../artifacts/a-living-handbook.md) encourages us to articulate a design system mission, outlining the goals and values guiding our endeavor. This mission statement should be revisited \(and, if need be, updated\) regularly. It also won't hurt to start compiling a shared slide deck containing our mission statement and a few vivid success stories, so that we're ready to pitch our vision at a moment's notice. These can include projects in which we used components from our library to speed up product development, engineering handoffs we eliminated, and misconceptions we resolved through cross-functional collaboration. What our early successes look like entirely depends on where and how we start to cultivate a design system‚Äîthe key takeaway is that we document them in a pitchable way and build up a repository of _propaganda material_. that always
