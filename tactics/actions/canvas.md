# Canvas!

Depending on where in the process of cultivating a design system we currently are, a lack of buy-in from important stakeholders \(such as other designers, engineers, product managers, or our superiors\) may bog down our efforts considerably. Even if we understand the value of an effective design system intuitively, it's still a rather abstract concept that is best explained using examples, such as early victories and cautionary tales.

> What our early successes look like entirely depends on where and how we start to cultivate a design system‚Äîthe key takeaway is that we document them in a pitchable way and build up a repository of _propaganda material_ we always have at hand.

Canvas! describes a pragmatic approach to intra-organizational design system advocacy‚Äîstill, some underlying structures will help us to reliably promote our proposition. [A Living Handbook](../artifacts/a-living-handbook.md) encourages us to articulate a design system mission, outlining the goals and values guiding our endeavor. This mission statement should be revisited \(and, if need be, updated\) regularly. It's also advisable to start compiling a shared slide deck containing our mission statement and a few vivid success stories right away, so that we're ready to pitch our vision at a moment's notice. These can include projects in which we used components from our library to speed up product development, engineering handoffs we eliminated, and misconceptions we resolved through cross-functional mediation. What our early successes look like entirely depends on where and how we start to cultivate a design system‚Äîthe key takeaway is that we document them in a pitchable way and build up a repository of _propaganda material_ we always have at hand.

## Architecting our own guerilla campaign

Once equipped with some promotional material, we can launch our first campaign forays to test the waters and spark wider discussions. We keep in mind to not only _promote_ and _educate_, but also to _listen_ and _learn_. As outlined in [Win Friends, not Battles](../principles/win-friends-not-battles.md), understanding each other's struggles and considering them as opportunities for improvement lies at the very heart of Lean Design System methodology. Being responsive to input and feedback will make it much easier to convince fellow coworkers‚Äîand ultimately improve the design of our system.

Whether we already have a working design system in place and aim to catalyze its adoption and development, or whether we just entered the ideation phase and want to recruit allies, there are several low-barrier formats we may consider for our canvassing purposes:

### Establish design system office hours

One very straightforward way to start conversations is establishing a dedicated, weekly _design system office hour_, during which everyone is invited to come by, inquire us about our efforts and goals, but also to provide feedback and propose new ideas, or to talk about specific pains and challenges. All it takes to launch this format is a note on a bulletin-board, a sign on our office door, a visible blocker in our shared calendar, or an aptly named channel in our communication tool‚Äîand, of course, the commitment to actually be available for the duration of the time slot.

### Hold sporadic, informal brown bag sessions

[Brown bag sessions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brown-bag-meeting.asp) \(or lunch-and-learn sessions\) are best suited to quickly share and discuss current developments and recent experiences. They should be informal, uncomplicated, and enjoyable. If we invite coworkers to a brown bag session, we should prepare a focused and coherent presentation to maximize effectiveness and, more importantly, be mindful of our coworkers' time.

### Develop and host training webinars

As soon as we have established a library of reusable components \(e.g., in the shape of a [UI Kit](../artifacts/ui-kits.md) or a [Design Tokens](../artifacts/design-tokens.md) repository\) or developed cross-functional workflows worth sharing with the larger team or organization, we should start considering webinars as an addition to our campaign. Planning a webinar is a rather time-consuming affair when compared to other canvassing formats, but once prepared, they will prove a powerful tool to reach everyone , can be recorded and made available in a shared location.







Goals: Make the design system visible. Make it tangible/understandable. Make it desirable - illustrate benefits. Make it likeable.

Clearly explains the Value Proposition, Principles and that makes it easy for anyone to present the Design Strategy to colleagues, partners, customers and investors.

Give our system a name. \(according to Spark almost a third of all design systems have to get by without a name\)
