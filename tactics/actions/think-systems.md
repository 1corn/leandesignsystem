# Think Systems!

Even before we commit to build a design system, we can \(and should\) start to cultivate a system mindset. This entails constantly being on the look-out for any variances, redundancies and bottlenecks in our daily work and processes, so we can figure out effective ways to eliminate them. For example, when we build or design new features, we should think about how every element would later be described as a reusable component and fit into a larger system, even if such a system does not currently exist. In our technical implementations, we think about what kind of abstraction layers might come in handy in the future, so we can introduce changes such as an update to our design language or an additional dark theme more seamlessly.

By over-engineering some components early on, like for example having a highly modular SCSS architecture even for a small one-page website or an extensive UI kit for a one-off customer project \[bewusstsein schaffen f√ºr die technischen implikationen der designentscheidungen, die wir treffen\]. More often than not, we can re-use these the effort we put will be well-worth it in the long run. In the worst case, we have still learned valuable lessons in the process. By , we train ourselves to become system ‚Ä¶

We also develop a better understanding of gaps in our considerations and a heightened sensibility for the intricacies of our designs. Why are we applying certain color shades to certain elements? Why border styles .. how many different types of animations are we using and for what specific reason\(s\)? Thinking and working with a system in mind helps us arrive at more purposeful ‚Äâ‚Äì‚Äâor less arbitrary ‚Äâ‚Äì‚Äâdesigns. And it prepares us for the development of actual design systems. The System Mindest is a tactic that fosters scalable and sustainable design work in a decentralized way. Everyone of us can start with ourselves and share their setbacks and wins with team mates, colleagues, and fellow designers and engineers in the larger community.
