# Tidy up!

Lean Design System encourages an approach of letting structures, workflows, and components evolve through project work and design explorations instead of having a long upfront \(Waterfall-like\) planning phase. If left entirely unchecked, such a natural flow may lead to clutter, unwanted variance, and other deficiencies we better avoid if we are to develop an effective and efficient design system.

{% hint style="info" %}
Ideas around the emergent design system are probably best summarized in [Minimum Viable Design System](../principles/minimum-viable-design-system.md) and [Steady Flow of Truth](../infrastructure/steady-flow-of-truth.md).

## Commit to consistent improvement

In software development, the term _refactoring_ describes the improvement of existing code without changing its \(external\) behavior. This can refer to better aligning code with agreed-upon conventions, eliminating redundancies, or the act of simplification. When cultivating a dynamic design system \(and especially when following Lean Design System methodology\) everyone involved should make a habit of refactoring any artifact they come in contact with. After completing a task, we should always try to clean up a couple issues we noticed‚Äîaiming to fix slightly more issues than we caused is a good rule-of-thumb to this. When we add a new component to a library \(whether in our [UI Kit](../artifacts/ui-kits.md), in our [Design Tokens](../artifacts/design-tokens.md) repository, or our [written documentation](../artifacts/a-living-handbook.md)\) we make it a part of our routine to repair the world around it.
