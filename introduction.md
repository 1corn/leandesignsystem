# Introduction

## Design systems are empowering teams and organizations

Today’s design systems are the culmination of decades of experience in building digital products collaboratively. Undeniably, they are becoming the leading paradigm for organizing, evolving, and extending the component libraries underpinning modern apps and platforms. An effective design system unites product teams around a common vision and design language. It represents a Single Source of Truth, provides us with battle-tested, reusable components, and defines the processes and responsibilities governing its ongoing development. It allows developers and designers to communicate effortlessly and enables them to deliver consistent experiences at any scale. An accessible and well-documented design system also simplifies onboarding processes, as it codifies implicit structures and standardizes workflows. In summary, it’s an immensely powerful concept that can truly empower digital product teams when implemented properly.

### So, where's the catch?

Design systems appear to be an optimal solution to achieve both scalability and consistent design quality. A solid component library can prevent technical and design debt accumulation and help teams build realistic prototypes at a staggering pace. However, they come with their own risks and costs, deterring especially smaller teams and resource-constrained startups. In their situation, promising opportunities must be tackled with everything they got and so recruiting a dedicated design systems team is a luxury they often can’t afford. Also, additional governance processes may quickly overburden a young organization lacking any buffers. And lastly, even if the required resources are in fact available and the decision is made to build a design system, it can easily take months, sometimes even years, until it becomes ready to be rolled out. Only then will it become apparent whether its components and processes can actually deliver the expected value.

## Lean Design System methodology

Lean Design System provides an evolving and modular set of 12 tactics \(organized in 4 layers\) aiming to allow any kind of organization \(even small, less design-savvy startups\) to dip their toes into design systems and more strategic design approaches. Every tactic is designed in such a way that it works in isolation, but is linked to other tactics supporting it, so that the library can be explored in a piecemeal manner. The methodology is driven by the idea that any digital product team can cultivate a naturally emerging design system by following a proposed set of principles and behaviors. The right infrastructure and a solid understanding of the artifacts that are to be maintained aim to provide a reliable and scalable framework for emergent systems. 

### 4 Layers

This brings us to the 4 layers categorizing the 12 tactics of Lean Design System:

1. Principles: Tactics on the Principles layer describe the methodology’s guiding principles and foundational concepts.
2. Infrastructure: Tactics on the Infrastructure layer describe what kind of organizational and technical structures can be derived from the Principles layer.
3. Behaviors: Tactics on the Behaviors level describe how action can be taken on the individual level at any time. It also describes behaviors that should be actively fostered to ensure steady improvement.
4. Artifacts: Lastly, tactics on the Artifacts level describe the actual artifacts organized in the design system’s libraries and repositories.

### Structure of a tactic

All tactics follow the same template: Each starts with an introduction outlining a challenge, an obstacle, or an opportunity followed by an in-depth description. Tactics conclude with a section explaining where they fit into the larger methodology, listing other tactics they're directly supporting as well as tactics they receive support from.

### Requirements

One of the goals of Lean Design System is to make the concept of design systems as accessible as somehow possible. Accordingly, there are only 3 requirements for adopting any of the proposed tactics:

1. A team or organization should have at least one front-end developer and one UI/UX designer working on digital products.
2. Teams and individuals have sufficient autonomy to experiment with new tools, workflows, and approaches.
3. Short lines of communication within an organization allow for the quick evaluation of results and experiences.

In case a team or organization only meets two or fewer requirements, a few adaptations to the methodology might be necessary. [Get Involved](contribute.md) explains how Lean Design System can be forked and customized for that very purpose.

## Ideas and values

Lean Design System builds on many years of experience in the the development of digital products and design systems at companies of all sizes—ranging from small startups to Fortune 100 enterprises. More importantly though, it incorporates ideas from outside domains such as lean thinking and modern software development to address resource-constraints in innovative ways. The methodology draws a lot of inspiration from Lean Startup, Extreme Programming, and DevOps. Ideas such as Minimum Viability, Collective Ownership, and Infrastructure-as-Code all had a substantial influence on the design of the individual tactics, as well as on the larger framework.

### Core values

Gegenentwurf zum monolithischen Designsystem approach, breaks it down into smaller chunks and outlines the idea of an adaptive, living system that grows and learns with its challenges and projects.

Lean Design System now looks into the collaboration within the development of design systems to enable seamless cross-functional interactions between designers and engineers and 

Lean Design System aims to provide us with tools to form a better understanding of our situation, our goals and our specific challenges, so that we can make better use of our time and resources. It proposes a more pragmatic approach and ways to divide the monolithic planning task of a design system into smaller, easier manageable parts. This allows us to shorten validation cycles and make effective use of our components much earlier in the process.

Let’s get one thing out of the way: What you won’t find here is a blueprint for a ready-made lean design system. Instead, this is a methodology for building any kind of design system—in a lean fashion. It doesn’t impose any specific design workflows or development paradigms. Lean Design System is tool-agnostic, technology-agnostic, and What it does, however, is help us make our product development successes repeatable and optimize our daily work. It shows ways to organically cultivate a design system, even 

Each tactic is designed such that it helps tackle the challenge of developing a design system in a certain way, but in a general, abstract way Imposes nothing

Make the design system a direct reflection of  the people cultivating it and the problems its addressing.

Generally, Lean Design System values:

* Exploration over planning
* Collective ownership over strict governance
* Workflows over tools



If you prefer to read the whole library of tactics from cover to cover, it is suggested that you follow the predefined order, starting with the guiding principles and then moving on to the less abstract strategic layers. This should give you a better understanding of how the individual layers support each other.

Do whatever it takes to to make it work, so that i can validate and learn what needs to come next - and oftentimes what needs to come next is bring it to a number of people and scale
